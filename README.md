# 🛠 Dadlas

**Validation-first AI development tooling with symbolic memory and reflective context control.**

Dadlas is a lightweight, developer-first system that gives large language models (LLMs) memory, structure, and traceability — not just autocomplete.

## ✨ What Makes Dadlas Different

- 🧩 **Reflective memory mesh** – Enables low-token, high-trust reasoning across codebases using internal constructs with S-Blocks and S-Tags
- 🔒 **Validation-first design** – Every AI action is scoped, traceable, and validated before changes are accepted
- 🧠 **Semantic scaffolding** – Adds symbolic structure to prompt-level reasoning without model retraining
- 🛠️ **Agent-aware memory handling** – Context is loaded with purpose, not just length
- 🔁 **Freeze-enforced safety** – Trusted logic is guarded against unintended AI edits or regressions


## 🧠 Architecture Highlights

- Runs inside a token-constrained working context (50K–75K) with dynamic symbolic recall
- Fully auditable: every change, tag, and validation trace is logged
- Designed for single-developer focus today, multi-agent cognition tomorrow

## 🧪 Use Cases

- Safe code refactoring with semantic change awareness
- AI agent memory alignment and behavior correction
- Grant-backed experimental tooling for DARPA-style cognition systems
